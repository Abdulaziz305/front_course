                    In my work, For he is a jolly good fellow, I focused on how
                    loneliness can affect a person's psyche and perceptions. I
                    have left this work ambiguous as to whether there are people
                    surrounding the subject through an exaggerated chiaroscuro
                    effect that would rarely been seen in life. The figures lack
                    of any significant relationship draws from my initial
                    exploration proposal and raises a question: does loneliness
                    truly mean having zero connection to people, or is it the
                    depth of those dynamics that decide that? Some people who
                    feel lonely may rarely interact with people, while others
                    are surround.
